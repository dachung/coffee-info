Here’re the highlights:

*   Started to open source our codebase & a new umbrella project called **libunison**_,_
*   Hired 2 new teammates & started targeting 100+ strategic partners,
*   Submitted an [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02881) **preprint **of neuroscience paper & updated our testnet architecture,
*   Continued growing TGI community & conducting 10+ podcast interviews.

### Open source & networking with libunison

We have identified _data availability_ and _block propagation _to be the **main bottlenecks** of scaling transactions with tens of thousands of (some potentially _malicious_) nodes over the Internet. Our insight is to use the [RaptorQ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6330) fountain code in conjunction with a forward error correction scheme for broadcasting message blocks, without incurring **round-trip delays** to recover from packet losses, over adversarial networks.

Here we’re launching our open source effort [github.com/harmony-one](http://github.com/harmony-one) with a [go-raptorq](https://github.com/harmony-one/go-raptorq) wrapper under our umbrella project **libunison **(see [our roadmap](http://harmony.one/libunison)).

Our **libunison** is an end-to-end and peer-to-peer networking library for any application that needs to _self-organize an emerging network_ of nodes. The library is built upon existing standardized technologies, including _Host Identity Protocol_ (HIPv2) and _Encryption Security Payload _(ESP), to leverage decades of research, development and deployment insights.

Harmony is open sourcing **libunison** as one of the foundational layers of not only [our network](https://harmony.one/network) but also other performant, decentralized networks such as peer multicasts.

### 2 new teammates & 100+ strategic partners

Our team is growing! [Chao Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mc8305/) (Amazon AI engineer, **Math Ph.D.** at CU Boulder, non-linear analysis researcher) is joining the team to tackle protocol research and statistical consensus. Chao has been researching blockchain algorithms since 2017 and recently implemented a [toy IPFS](https://github.com/chaosma/dfs) for fun.

So did our good friend [Li Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lijiang2087/) (GSV Capital, logistics startup founder, Northwestern University adjunct, nickname 蒋·和梦·犁). Li has been our evangelist since our **first China trip** in February and finally decided to [jump off the cliff](https://medium.com/@lijiang2087/started-from-the-bottom-now-ad435ecb4aa4) to lead Harmony’s partnership efforts full time. As [the newest node](https://medium.com/harmony-one/meet-the-harmony-team-f211ea407b48) _with awe _on the Harmony team, Li also serves as [“Chief Frisbee Officer”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=bL_yAmJKE1Q)to keep us active in the winter.

We are planning our second token sale. Inspired by these insightful articles [by Multicoin](https://multicoin.capital/2018/10/23/the-evolving-role-of-crypto-investors/) and [by Notation](https://medium.com/notation-capital/notation-blockchain-mining-2-0-dcf46a28f7eb) on _value-adding investors_ as operators, we are asking our new investors to operate Harmony nodes. **Scalability** and **decentralization** are the two most important metrics for Harmony to succeed. We will achieve both by having tens of thousands of nodes, the scale of Bitcoin and Ethereum, run by many _independent entities_ in jurisdictions all over the world.

Having many nodes is key to network **performance** with our sharding approach; meanwhile having independent entities is key to network** security**with our permissionless principle. If you are non-US based and looking to participate in this strategic round, contact us at [harmony.one/partners](http://harmony.one/partners).

### Neuroscience preprint & testnet architecture

Our colleague Prof. Lau has led our team with his research and submitted a paper “[Blockchain and human episodic memory](https://medium.com/harmony-one/blockchain-and-human-episodic-memory-9a6a4ed685ee)” (see [preprint on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02881)) on relating _brain consciousness _to _blockchain consensus_. We highlight that certain phenomena studied in the brain, namely **metacognition**, reality monitoring, and how perceptual conscious experiences come about, may inspire development in blockchain technology too, specifically regarding **probabilistic consensus protocols**.

Our colleague Ka-yuet Liu, also at UCLA, has published [Data Marketplace for Scientists](https://medium.com/harmony-one/data-marketplace-for-scientists-7666afb68569) in our blog. She highlights a modern economic theory of the [nonrivalry of data](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/nonrivalry-economics-data), concluding that _“blockchain can turn wasteful competition between large-scale science projects into synergy” _among internationally recognized scientists like themselves.

Our [testnet architecture](https://harmony.one/architecture) has been updated to apply the latest research results and progress made by [Ethereum 2.0](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQs). **Zero-knowledge proofs** by [Starkware](https://multicoin.capital/2018/10/30/our-investment-in-starkware/)are now fast enough to be generated on mobile clients and may be used [to scale blockchains](https://twitter.com/stse/status/1057844527652716544) by many orders of magnitude. [Fraud proofs](https://tokyo2018.scalingbitcoin.org/files/Day1/improving-spv-client-validation-and-security-with-fraud-proofs.pdf) (with _2D erasure codes_ and _interleaved sampling_), [stateless clients](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968.pdf) (with algebraic vector commitment), comparing [synchronous](https://research.vmware.com/publications/synchronous-byzantine-agreement-with-expected-o-1-rounds-expected-o-n2-communication-and-optimal-resilience) (with 10 exact round complexity vs previously 29) versus [partially synchronous](https://research.vmware.com/publications/validated-asynchronous-byzantine-agreement-with-optimal-resilience-and-asymptotically-optimal-time-and-word-communication) protocols, and integrating [99% fault tolerance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/07/99_fault_tolerant.html) (with hybrid **threshold-dependent** and **latency-dependent**consensus) are on our roadmap.

### Growing TGI community & 10+ interviews

Early this month, we had an in-depth _founder interview_ [with Hacker Noon](https://harmony.one/hackernoon), one of the most-read publications **among engineers** and entrepreneurs. On the topic of attracting users and building communities, we answered “_some conversations are multiplicative — we multiply each other’s dreams. And every once in a while, _**_a conversation is exponential_**_, meaning we really build deep belief in each other’s vision and can make it come to life_.”

Furthermore, Spencer writes about [the Future of Scalable Blockchain](https://medium.com/futuresin/ethereum-2-0-and-the-future-of-scalable-blockchain-389cfcc7760c) and compares Harmony to Ethereum 2.0, Dfinity, Cardano and Nervos, complimenting that Harmony’s approach “_is highly cerebral and in tune with the best technology currently available… their spirit of inclusion and entrepreneurship feels a bit more sincere._”

### Essential advice & your help

We’re taking the top two points from [_Y-Combinator’s Essential Startup Advice_](https://harmony.one/yc)(posted next to our coffee machine) to heart: **Launch now, **and **Build something people want**_._

We published [a survey on blockchain testnets](https://medium.com/@leo_hao/https-medium-com-leo-hao-blockchain-testnets-survey-7e0612cf5d72) and we’re laser-focused on building our own public testnet, implementing _information dispersal algorithm_, _state syncing_ and **_resharding_** at the moment.

Lastly, we need your help on hiring _database engineers _to hack **Byzantine agreements** and broadcasts, and on bringing in _strategic investors_ to run Harmony nodes all over the world!
